-Target
-Target is set to target=Blank right now, where it just opens the picture in a new tab.

if you wanted to create a page for the picture and a seperate button for it, you will have to create a html page and then put a separate button side that page for that specific filename

-This will also help when you are creating a writting text file app, where you will need multiple buttons to traverse the page.
